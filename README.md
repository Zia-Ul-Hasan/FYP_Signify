# Hand Gestures to Speech

## Overview

Hand Gestures to Speech is a mobile application designed to assist deaf individuals who cannot speak by converting hand gestures into spoken words. The app uses a trained machine learning model to recognize 40 common English words through hand gestures captured via the phone's camera. This innovative solution aims to improve communication and enhance the daily lives of its users.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Utilize the device's camera to interpret hand gestures in real-time.
- **Speech Output**: Convert recognized gestures into spoken words using text-to-speech technology.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation and usability.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Ability to expand to additional languages in future updates.
- **Educational Resources**: Includes tutorials and practice modes to help users learn gestures effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Mobile Framework**: Flutter
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow or PyTorch (for training the gesture recognition model)
- **Text-to-Speech**: [Google Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) or similar service
- **Backend**: Firebase (for user data and app settings)
